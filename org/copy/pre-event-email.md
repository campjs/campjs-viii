## A Reminder about our Code of Conduct

We linked to it earlier in the things to bring section under "[Good Attitude](http://viii.campjs.com/code-of-conduct/)".

It's worth reminding ourselves that CampJS is a community event, made up of a diverse bunch of people and we all want to be treated with respect.

Let's all do our absolute best to do exactly that (respect each other) over the weekend so that CampJS continues to be regarded as one of the most welcoming events around.
