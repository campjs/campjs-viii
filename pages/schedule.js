          Connecting devices to the web has become possible with technologies like Node.js. From blinking an LED to building a smart mirror, the possibilities are endless; but something new has come! With the release of the Web Bluetooth API, BLE devices can now be connected to a browser with a simple click! This talk will take you through my journey of creating a framework to interact with the Myo armband in the browser using this brand new and shiny Web API.

        ‚ÄúI tried it once, it was just too slow‚Äù. It‚Äôs a refrain I hear too often, but in the fast paced world of development (especially JavaScript) when was the last time that something was still the same as it was years ago? PhoneGap and Cordova are no exception. With the proliferation of faster hardware, better and more up to date webviews, and cutting edge JS frameworks... Hybrid App Development could be the solution you need. Between the rapid development cycle, the benefit of using existing web domain knowledge, a path to publishing PWAs for platforms that support it, and the potential for a large amount of shared code... isn‚Äôt it time you gave it another look?

        With competition between browser vendors heating up, Javascript performance has improved greatly over the past decade, but now WebAssembly is set to change the game. Introducing a new binary format that brings near-native speeds, WebAssembly is a completely different way of thinking about web development. So what does this mean for Javascript, security, and the web platform as a whole?

        iflix is one of the largest SVOD services for developing countries in the world, going from 0 to 1 million users in less than six months, and adding on many more millions ever since. Unlike western and first-world countries, many users don‚Äôt have the luxury of a functioning broadband connection. So how do you get your service to users in Nigeria - when nobody has a computer, and mobile data is at an extreme premium? This talk will cover everything from using Lambda & S3 for serving content, to maintaining Kubernetes for realtime services, all the way to deploying our own mini-CDN¬†across Asia, Africa and the Middle East.

      </Text>
      <Text>
        Lambda: great for tracking ‚Äôasync‚Äô reqs. Not good to use for realtime because of latency in these countries.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        S3: Static EVERYTHING. Can be cached at edge nodes instead of having to travel back to nearest region w/ AWS DC
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Physical infra: Deliver everything way faster than using traditional internet. Install servers in local internet hubs & in Telcos.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        CDN: Akamai/CF. End user traffic only has to hit local edge node, which is then sent over the internet using CDN connection rather than users slow internet connection. Also caching.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Kubernetes: Helps us maintain massive scale, runs all our realtime services, dynamic autoscaling etc.

The Magikcraft Open Source Platform is also the fastest way to write Minecraft mods in real-time in JavaScript using only a web-browser. We could do a hackathon at CampJS and produce cool mods for kids around the world to play with. Magikcraft integrates with GitHub, and has an API editor that allows you to write APIs that kids can code to.

      <Text is='p'>Having built an API server in NodeJs, and testing it using mocha+chai+sinon, we migrated the tests over to Jest. There were several hard-won lessons along the way, which requires one to change the way they approach writing tests. Some of the paradigms involved are:</Text>

      <Box>2. DRY vs DAMP</Box>
      <Box>3. snapshotting</Box>

      <Box>1. Jest was developed by FB, and they primarily use it to test in-browser Javascript, and is engineered tightly to work with ReactJs (also developed by FB). That being said, Jest is on its own a very versatile test framework. This talk is for those who would like a perspective of the more "general" use case for Jest.</Box>
      <Box>2. Jest is also the new kid on the block, with mocha and other test frameworks having been around for much longer. This talk is for those who are using one of these other test frameworks on their existing projects, and considering switching to Jest.</Box>

We‚Äôd rather look at graphs, or, even better, have the possibility of interacting with the data. And we have probably all created some graphs.
