    <p>One of the best aspects of CampJS is the community. Over the past 6 events, that community has only grown stronger. As CampJS is a community run event, there is always plenty to help with. If you want to help in any way (or just get in on all the pre-camp excitement), head over to the #campjs channel on the <a href='http://view-source-radboats.herokuapp.com/'>View Source Slack</a>.</p>
    <p>Also have a look at the open <a href="https://github.com/campjs/campjs-next/issues">issues on github</a> and see where you can help out. Any help is appreciated.</p>
